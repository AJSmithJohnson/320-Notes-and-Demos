	----------------------------------------------------
	0   4   asciii   	packet type:  "JOIN"
	4	1	uint8		join repsonse: 
	5   1   uint8  		error id (see below)
	join response
	--------------------
	(Accepted) 
	1: is player "X"

	0   4   asciii  	packet type: "UPDT"
	4   1   uint8 		whose turn( 1 / 2)
	5   1   uint8		who's won? (see below)
	6   9   uint8 x9    the values in spots 1-9

	who's won

	0:  playing the game....(no winner)

	----------------------------------------------------
	0 	4 	ascii 		packet type: "CHAT"
	4   1   uint8  		length of the sender's username
	5   2   uint16  	length of the chat message 
	7   ? 	ascii 		sender's username
	?   ?   ascii       chat message

	O  	L  	Datatype 	Desc

	0   4   asciii      packet type: "JOIN"

CHAT  - The player wants to chat.

	O  	L  	Datatype 	Desc
	----------------------------------------------------
	0 	4	ascii 		packet type: "CHAT"

	O  	L  	Datatype 	Desc
	----------------------------------------------------
