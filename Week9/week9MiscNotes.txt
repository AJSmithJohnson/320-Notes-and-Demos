TCP = transmition control protocol
	Gurentees every packet you send arrives
	Every packet arrives in order
	Sends extra packets in the background to make sure packets are recieved
UDP = user datagram protocol
	Doesn't make gurentees that packet will get to destination 



For Certain types of applications where you want speed you should switch to UDP. Technically the packets aren't moving faster but because we are sending fewer packets
we can potentially send more info in the same amount of time.

Difference between latency and bandwidth
Bandwidth is the amount of info sent




///
in TCP there were multiple pieces that could be grouped together we had to create a buffer and a new packet would come in. In buffer we would look for 
complete packets and pull them out

in udp when you recieve a discrete message you just process it and then that's it. You either get the message or you don't. We don't need to worry about
consuming bytes or anything



//state in boardgames tends to change more slowly
//with a boardgame you don't need to worry about realtime
//if you read enough books on multiplayer programming
	//real time games often have to be percieved as if they are turn based//a turn has to be a 60h of a second
